# How-to-build-a-robot-using-Python-Turtle

turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.

We can have our own version of a ROBOT

My version of a Robot is a stealthy one :) Enjoy!
